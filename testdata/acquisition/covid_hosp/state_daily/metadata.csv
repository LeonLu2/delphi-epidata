This allows for a more comprehensive picture of the hospital utilization within a state by ensuring a hospital is represented, even if they miss a single day of reporting.</br>\n\n<br>No statistical analysis is applied to account for non-response and/or to account for missing data.</br>\n\n<br>The below table displays one value for each field (i.e., column). Sometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to both HHS TeleTracking and HHS Protect.
