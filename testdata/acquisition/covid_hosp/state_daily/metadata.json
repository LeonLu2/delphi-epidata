These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.</p>\n<p>The file will be updated daily and provides the latest values reported by each facility within the last four days. This allows for a more comprehensive picture of the hospital utilization within a state by ensuring a hospital is represented, even if they miss a single day of reporting.</p>\n<p>No statistical analysis is applied to account for non-response and/or to account for missing data.</p>\n<p>The below table displays one value for each field (i.e., column). Sometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to both HHS TeleTracking and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, deduplication is applied: specifically, HHS selects the TeleTracking record provided directly by the facility over the state-provided data to HHS Protect.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://healthdata.gov/covid-19-reported-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state-data-dictionary\">COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Data Dictionary</a></p>\n",
