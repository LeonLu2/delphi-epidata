# Survey Weights
{: .no_toc}

The survey's individual response files contain respondent weights calculated
by Facebook. These weights are also used to produce our
[public contingency tables](./contingency-tables.md) and the geographic aggregates
[in the COVIDcast Epidata API](../api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.md).

Facebook has provided documentation to describe the calculation and usage of
these weights, [available here](symptom-survey-weights.pdf). This documentation
explains the weight methodology, gives examples of how to use the weights when
calculating estimates, and states the known limitations of the weights. We also
have separate information about the [survey's limitations](limitations.md) that
affect what conclusions can be drawn from the survey data.
